This application is great for anyone that likes to check the weather before an upcoming trip. It gives you the ability to check the current weather of any city in the US, as well as the 5-day forecast. Just type in the city you would like to look-up and the weather will be displayed.

Upon your next visit, your search history will still be there. If you want to recheck a city, just click on the city and an updated weather report will display for you.

This week our task was to retrieve information from a third party API to access their data for a weather dashboard. I chose to use the [OpenWeatherAPI](https://openweathermap.org/api) for this project. This application runs in the browswer and has features that dynamically update the HTML and CSS files upon the user's input.
